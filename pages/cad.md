I picked up CAD as a hobby in 2016 and have since developed some skills in parametric modeling. I use Autodesk's Fusion360 as well as different 2D programs.
I've been featured on Autodesks gallery before and have taught a class on CAD in 2018.

## Services

- 3D models as sources for CNC machining or 3D printing
- 2D waterjet drawings (.dxf)
- General technical drawings
- Renderings for advertisements etc.
- Animations

## What I'll need from you

I can work from

- hand drawings
- technical drawings
- photos
- physical products

or create a design from the ground up.

Based on that I'll send you prototypes while the model is being created.
