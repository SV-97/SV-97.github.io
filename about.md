## Overview

I am an Electrician for buildings and power services, state certified engineer for electrical engineering specialized in IT, PLC-specialist, currently studying industrial mathematics.
I do CAD work on the side - usually for knifemakers.

I mainly do Python, Rust and a bit of Haskell - but like to try new languages all the time.

## (Programming) History

Probably the first thing I've done was AutoIt (without understanding anything) as a kid. I then got into contact with PLC programming in my apprenticeship - at the same time I did a fair amount of SQF, when I was active in an ArmA clan, where I worked with a buddy doing his masters in CS at that time and thus always had someone to ask if I didn't get something/to explain things to me.  
After my apprenticeship I worked for a year and got training as an PLC specialist which helped a lot with asm later on. When I decided to become a state certified engineer, our class needed a calendar system to manage exams etc., which I promptly coded up in GoogleAppScript (essentially JavaScript) so that it'd work with the class's Google calendar.  
In the first year of the s.c. technician training I learned basic C# and started learning Python on the side (must've been around new year's), because using Excel was just too big of a pain. Over that year's summer holidays I then got _really_ into Python, read a 1000-page book on it and practically programmed all day. Fittingly I also did my finals project (["Test- and integrationsystem for SCADA-software"](https://github.com/SV-97/TUInventory/blob/master/TUInventory/Documentation/Documentation.pdf)) with Python (and a tad bit of Rust).  
In the second year I got into contact with a lot of languages, because I specialized my degree in IT (Further C#, C (which I already knew some but no idea from where, must've picked it up over the years), Assembly for 8-bit AVRs, HTML (I said language, not _programming_ language ;)), CSS, PHP, SCL/ST). I also started reading books on programming etc. intensively in my sparetime, by way of which I got insights into lots of languages/paradigms (C/C++, Haskell, Rust, Java, ...).
